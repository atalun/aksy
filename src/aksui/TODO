Official tasks *should* go in Trac, but when burnout wins: new tasks go here. - Joseph

Keygroup Editor TODO
	* Create AkEntryBox, override of Gtk.Entry widget. Use for program/multi names, maybe zone sample name (would probably want this to be part of an autocomplete combo box type thing)?
    * Add panel titles
    * Add 'collapse' functionality to panels
    * Add panel for LFO
    * Add panel for Modulation Matrix
    * Fix ComboBox size (Too tall, looks pretty clunky)
    
    * Start utilizing alternative operations to pre-cache data when appropriate
    
General TODO
	* Fix AKP uploading (doesn't load dependencies)
