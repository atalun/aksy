- better controls: knobs, more compact sliders
- multifx editor w/ glade
- recording tools
- multi editor
- main menu: create new program, add/delete keygroup,  
- mpc pad editor (custom widget)
- widget for a low to high range, use for zone vel and kg notes (should be easy..?)
- simpler interface for grabbing a widget by path and adding it into a parent widget
- reading akp files to figure out what samples they need
    In trunk/.../z48/akptools.py
    - Program / p = Program('filename', 'r')
    - p.keygroups[].zones[]
- reading akm files to figure out what akp files they need
- delayed loading of program editor sections
- batching commands?
- cache fx names + parameters

Prioritized:
- Modulation Matrix Shortcuts
- Modulation Matrix
- Refactor the various editors (program and keygroup specifically) to use new base classes.
- Create range widget w/ start/end/min/max like 0 [--O=======O----] 127.

Modulation Matrix:
- Read each pin, keep settings in list

Q-Link:
- destinations correlate w/ modulation matrix
- fx destinations are list of params (indices are available)

Impulse Tracker Module Functions
  Austin has informed me that his postmod function for exporting samples from an .it module is simple:
  import itx; it = ITX(fname="baobao.it");  it.exportSamples("c:\\proswell\\temp")
- this would be a neat way to grab samples quickly and create programs
- UPDATE: this is working

Keygroup Visualizer
  I want to be able to quickly see keygroups by range and perhaps other information such as whether there's a sample in a zone.

    # NOTES          ZONES
      C1 ...... C5 | 1 2 3 4
    0    _________   ^ - _
    1 __________     # # -      <-  adjust keygroup range from first section
                                    on hover, display information such as zones
                                    click open keygroup editor
                                    on right click, provide shortcuts, cut+paste, etc
                                    possible zone velocity range display by filling up vertically
                                    maybe hover over zone to see what sample is in there
                                    click to jump to zone editor
                                    context menu to assign a sample quickly to a zone, cut+paste, etc
                                    collapse keygroup range if possible
                                    option to hide empty zone keygroups (for drum programs)
