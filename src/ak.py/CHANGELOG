- added impulse tracker module sample ripping -> uploading via Austin Luminais's Postmod code (in ./postmod) - note that this does not yet upsample 8-bit samples and this is an issue
- switched out samplerobject.update(), now this uses __getattribute__ to pull attributes and caches the results, update() claears the cache
- UI.filechooser.upload()
- UI.filechooser.open() - added switch for upload, now its possible to use this to get a simple list
