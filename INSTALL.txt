1. REQUIREMENTS/DEPENDENCIES

Aksy has the following dependencies:

* Python: version > 2.2

* libusb: libusb.sourceforge.net
  (win32 port is available at libusb-win32.sourceforge.net)

optional dependencies
---------------------

To run some of the scripts, some more packages are needed.

* wxPython

* aubio

The extension has been tested with python 2.3.5, libusb 0.1.8 and libusb-0.1.10

If you're running linux and want to be able to run aksy as normal user
(recommended), install hotplug.

2. INSTALLATION

To install the aksy python modules and the aksyxusb extension, run: 

python setup.py build
python setup.py install (as root)

On big endian machines, set _BIG_ENDIAN to 1 in the setup.py file. This will
probably go away soon.
