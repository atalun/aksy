1. REQUIREMENTS/DEPENDENCIES

Aksy (core lib) has the following dependencies:

* Python: version >= 2.4

* libusb: libusb.sourceforge.net
  (win32 port is available at libusb-win32.sourceforge.net)

The extension has been tested with Python 2.4/2.5, libusb 0.1.8 and libusb-0.1.10

optional dependencies
---------------------

To run aksyfsview, wxPython is needed. Ak.py (by Joseph Misra) needs a recent GTK and its python bindings.

If you're running linux and want to be able to run aksy as normal user
(recommended), install hotplug.

2. INSTALLATION

To install the aksy python modules and the aksyxusb extension, run: 

python setup.py build
python setup.py install (as root)

To compile with Mingw 5.3.1 on Windows using Python 2.5:

python setup.py build -c mingw32
python setup.py install --skip-build
